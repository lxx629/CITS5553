# CITS5553 Project Work Repository (indivisual part)

This repository contains a record of all the work I contributed throughout the project.  
It documents my data exploration, cleaning, integration, and visualisation processes across different stages and tools.

## Structure Overview

### 1. **R Files**
The R scripts record my early-stage work on **data exploration, cleaning, and integration**.  
These files show how the initial datasets were examined, refined, and combined into structured formats for analysis.

### 2. **Python Files**
The Python scripts are **replications of the R data processing workflow**, rewritten in Python.  
They were developed to make the data cleaning and integration process **reproducible** and compatible with the final group dataset.

### 3. **Visualisation**
This folder contains:
- My **early visualisation attempts** using Google Colab, and  
- The **final Power BI dashboard link**, which was embedded in our groupâ€™s web application.

### 4. **Data Files**
This folder includes:
- The **raw data** used in the R scripts (unprocessed source files), and  
- The **merged datasets** created after cleaning and integration.

The goal of this repository is to provide a transparent record of my technical work and the data-processing workflow behind our project results.
